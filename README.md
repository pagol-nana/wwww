# f you do not already have Node installed, you should go ahead and install it. You can visit the official website to download and install Node.js. NPM comes pre-installed with Node.

2. Initialize a Git Repository
Create a new project folder for your package and navigate into the folder. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

git init
This will help you track the changes you make to your package. Also, make sure you have a remote version of your repository on GitHub (or your preferred hosting service).

3. Initialize NPM in Your Project
To do this, navigate to the root directory of your project and run the following command:

npm init
This command will create a package.json file. You will get prompts to provide the following information:

package-name: As you learned earlier in this tutorial, the name of your package must be unique. Also it must be lowercase. It may include hyphens.
version: The initial value is 1.0.0. You update the number when you update your package using semantic versioning.
description: You can provide a description of your package here. Indicate what your package does and how to use it.
entry point: The entry file for your code. The default value is index.js.
test command: Here, you can add the command you want to run when a user runs npm run test.
git repository: The link to your remote repository on GitHub.
keywords: Add relevant keywords that will help others find your package on the NPM registry.
